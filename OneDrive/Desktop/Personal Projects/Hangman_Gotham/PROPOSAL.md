# Hangman Gotham

I would like to create a Batman themed **Hangman** game. The game gives the 
player a movie name to guess which has only the vowels provided. The player has 
to guess an alphabet or digit of the name. With each correct guess, all 
instances of that alphabet in the game is populated. With a wrong guess, a 
silhouette of a hanging man starts drawing. The game is over in two case:
1) The player correctly guesses the name of all the movies (in which case the 
player wins the game).
2) The hangman is completely drawn (in which case the player loses the round
and the game)

In my version, the puzzles would be given by Joker and you, as Batman, would
have to solve each puzzle to save the civilian or the civilian would be hung.

I used to play this game a lot with my friends throughout my school life and I 
remember how engaging it used to be. I've had some great memories of playing 
this game and I remember how competitive it could get. Thus, this game would
incorporate two of my favourite things:
1) Comic theme for a comic-geek like me
2) A game that gets me nostalgic for my pre-teen years and High School.

I would use Cinder to create the game. I will use a .txt file to create a 
database of Batman movie names. I would use sqlite3 and sqlite-modern-cpp to
to maintain a leaderboard of scores.

I intend to create my database and incorporate it into my game by the end of
week 2. By the mid of week 3, I should have the game engine ready and a working 
model of the game. By the end of week 3, I should have the project ready with
testing and all.

If I finish early, I would improve the graphics and audio of the game and then, 
try and add some additional features to the game, the specifics of which are to 
be decided.
