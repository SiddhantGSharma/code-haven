# Development Log
#### November 24, 2020
This week we went over the overarching structure of our project. We decided on using a Node struct to hold airport information such as the name, 3 digit code, longitude and latitude. We agreed on helper functions that would help us calculate distances between airports which can be used as weights for edges. We also divided tasks between group members.

We have implemented the Graph API in which we will be using for our algorithms as well. Overall we have been doing great progess with the implementations and we don't doubt that we will be reaching our goals by this first half of next week. We are also planning on writing up some test cases so that we don't run in to any issues when we will be handing off the final project. Lastly, if we do reach our goals with some extra time then the plan is to possibly go after some kind of visualization that will help us see the airports. But this won't be part of grading just an extra thing.

This week we went over our progress in our delegated tasks. We finished the Parser code, the Graph implementation, and the basic DFS traversal. We also debugged the segfault for the Dijkstra algorithm. We went over our new goals for this week which are to finish A* and work on the Results report and the final video.
