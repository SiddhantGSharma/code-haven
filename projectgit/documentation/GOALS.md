# Goals
Our dataset: [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html)

For our traversal we will be using DFS Traversal which will be how we will go through the graph overall.

Next for one of our algorithms we will be using Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between one airport to another using the the OpenFlights data source as mentioned before.

Lastly our other complex option is going to be A* search in which we will attempt to improve our shortest path finding too.

If we get done after this then the goal is to create some kind of graph visualization of some sort. This might be using React JS and AntD Graphic Visualizer.
