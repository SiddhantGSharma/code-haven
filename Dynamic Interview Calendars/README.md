Author: Siddhant Sharma

This script fetches data from a Google Sheet and generates dynamic interview calendars for teams. 
Add query parameter "key" with department or member name to display calendars filtered. Default "key" is "Paige Taylor"
E.g. https://cal.jerseystem.org/interviewcalendars?key=CAL.HUCA.LND-Paige%20Taylor-CAL.PODS.COD
